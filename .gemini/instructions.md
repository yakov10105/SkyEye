# 🚨 CRITICAL: Task Management Rule

**MANDATORY AFTER EVERY TASK COMPLETION:**

After completing ANY task, you MUST immediately update its status in the project's designated tracking system (e.g., JIRA, GitHub Issues, a PRD).

1.  Find the completed task.
2.  Change its status to reflect completion (e.g., "Done", "Resolved", "✅").
3.  Dont Continue automaticly to the next task, let me review the changes and ask for permission to continue.

**This is not optional. Keeping task statuses up-to-date is critical for team coordination and project tracking.**
